"""This module solves a maze using breadth-first or depth-first search.

Depth-first search (DFS) is carried out with a stack, while breadth-
first search (BFS) is carried out with a queue.

Submodules:
- maze.py
  Maze class encapsulates maze data and provides methods for accessing
  and displaying it.

- datastruct.py
  Contains the LinkedList class which Stack and Queue inherit.

- adt.py
  Contains the Stack and Queue classes, which are used to keep track of
  unexplored paths.

- cq.py
  Contains the CircularQueue class, as an alternative to Queue.
