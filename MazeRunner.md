This repl contains an algorithm that figures out a way out of the maze.

The implementation here uses a Stack to store the coordinates to be explored at each step. The Stack data structure is implemented using a LinkedList.

`main.py` and `maze.py` contain complete code to solve a maze, but `datastruct.py` and `adt.py` are incomplete!

----------

# Your task

## Part 1: LinkedList

1. Implement the `LinkedList` class in `datastruct.py` to enable the maze to be solved.
2. Use your own tests, to check your `LinkedList` implementation.

Remember to remove the `raise NotImplementedError` lines. While the `pass` keyword allows the program to continue silently without any code to run, the `NotImplementedError` halts the program. Very useful to remind yourself of parts of the code that are not yet ready and still need work!

**Technical notes:**

LinkedList is a **data structure**. That means there is a detailed specification for how it should be implemented.

----------

## Part 2: Stack and Queue

The program in `main.py` uses a Stack to implement a **depth-first search** strategy. This approach checks a single route at a time, exploring until it reaches a dead end before backtracking to the last unexplored fork.

1. Implement the `Stack` and `Queue` classes in `adt.py` to enable the maze to be solved.
2. Use your own tests, to check your `Stack` and `Queue` implementations.  
If it works correctly, you should see the program successfully find its way out of the maze!
3. Observe the difference in the way the maze is explored when Stack and Queue are used.
4. Edit the program in `main.py`, replacing the Stack with a Queue (and using appropriate queue methods). This switches the strategy to a **breadth-first search**. All encountered routes are checked simultaneously and advance one step each cycle.

**Technical notes:**

Stacks and queues are not data structures; instead, they are **abstract data types**. That means:

- "Abstract": There is no detailed specification for they should be implemented. One can reasonably use any implementation so long as the behaviour of the class is correct.  
  However, the choice of implementation will have implications for efficiency.
- "Data type": there are expectations of how stacks and queues should behave.
  - Stacks are expected to behave first-in-last-out (FILO)
  - Queues are expected to behave first-in-first-out (FIFO)

----------

## Part 3: CircularQueue

A Circular Queue is a **fixed size** queue where the next item that comes after the tail (last item) is the head (first item).

The fixed size of a Circular Queue makes it much easier to implement `enqueue()` and `dequeue()` methods, as there is no need to implement insert/append/delete methods. Instead, the `head` and `tail` attributes keep track of the indexes where exising items will be dequeued, and where new items will be enqueued.

1. Implement the `CircularQueue` class in `cq.py` to enable the maze to be solved.
2. Use your own tests, to check your `Circular Queue` implementation.
3. Edit `main.py` to use a `CircularQueue` class instead of a `Queue`.  
If it works correctly, you should see the program successfully find its way out of the maze (using breadth-first search)!

## Implementation

### Head and tail
There is no standard convention which end the circular queue should be dequeued at or dequeued from. For this project, we will enqueue at `tail` and dequeue from `head`.

When the circular queue is empty, no dequeueing is possible. The `head` is thus initialised with an invalid index, and reset to the same invalid index whenever the queue is empty again.

When the circular queue is full, no enqueueing is possible (because the size is fixed). The `tail` is set to an invalid index whenever the queue is full.

When implemented as a (fixed-size) `Array`, additional logic has to be written for the head/tail indexes to "wrap around" to 0 after the last index. This can be abstracted using a private `increment()` method.

### Enqueue

When enqueueing an item, the following operations need to be carried out:

1. Check if queue is full (`tail` is invalid), raise an error if so.
2. Add the item at the `tail` index.
3. Increment the `tail` index, with wrap-around.
4. Check if the queue is full (`tail` points to `head`), invalidate `head` if necessary.

### Dequeue

When dequeueing an item, the following operations need to be carried out:

1. Check if queue is empty (`head` is invalid), raise an error if so.
2. Increment the `head` index, with wrap-around.
3. Check if the queue is empty (`head` points to `tail`), invalidate `tail` if necessary.
4. Return the item

**Technical notes:**

CircularQueue is *both* a data structure and an abstract data type. Circular queues are expected to be statically allocated, which typically implies using static arrays.

At the same time, there are expectations of how the circular queue should behave. The circular queue must follow the same behaviour as queues, and it must be implemented such that the head wraps around to its tail.
